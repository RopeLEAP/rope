# LeapRope
#### An exercise in studying existing data structures and creating test scripts to compare performance. Structures used include: a rope (code from ICSharpCode's AvalonEdit's rope structure), Wintellect's PowerCollections BigList, and .NET's StringBuilder data structures.


### How To Use The Project
Clone the project; place the warandpeace.txt file in a folder on your local drive (c:\repos\files\warandpeace.txt) - you can download the file from the Rope channel on our slack. Make sure that RopeWebApp is set as the startup project, build and run. A web browser will open and the test options will be displayed. You can use different files by changing the filenames in Services/AppendTest and TestService classes (or you can just use the same name for a file of your choice). You can play with the node size by changing it in RopeNode.cs in the Rope project.
